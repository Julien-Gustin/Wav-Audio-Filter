/*
 * INFO0062 - Object-Oriented Programming
 * Dummy filter to test the audio.jar library
 *
 * Example of class implementing the Filter interface (see statement of the project), provided as
 * a tool to test the audio.jar library before starting the project.
 *
 * This filter is designed to let samples pass through for a given duration, before cutting them
 * for the same duration (by replacing all of them with 0's), then let them pass again, etc.
 *
 * In practice, if you use duration = 44100 * 3, the WAV file after filtering will contain 3
 * seconds of the initial file, then 3 seconds of nothing, then 3 seconds of the original content,
 * and so on and so forth.
 *
 * In the Example.java from project_basis, you can instantiate a MyFilter object with this class
 * with either of the next instructions (duration of cutoff = 3 seconds):
 * -"Filter myFilter = new DummyFilter(44100 * 3);"
 * -"DummyFilter myFilter = new DummyFilter(44100 * 3);"
